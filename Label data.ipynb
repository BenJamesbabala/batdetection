    "Last week I discovered that there are bats outside of my appartment. To detect when there is one I took a \"bat detector\", a device that brings the high pitched noise bats make back to hearable levels. To split the data into \"batsound\" and \"no sound\" I made this Jupyter notebook to label the data.\n",
